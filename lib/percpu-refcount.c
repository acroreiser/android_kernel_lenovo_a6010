/*
 * Initially, a percpu refcount is just a set of percpu counters. Initially, we
 * don't try to detect the ref hitting 0 - which means that get/put can just
 * increment or decrement the local counter. Note that the counter on a
 * particular cpu can (and will) wrap - this is fine, when we go to shutdown the
 * percpu counters will all sum to the correct value
 *
 * (More precisely: because moduler arithmatic is commutative the sum of all the
 * percpu_count vars will be equal to what it would have been if all the gets
 * and puts were done to a single integer, even if some of the percpu integers
 * overflow or underflow).
 *
 * The real trick to implementing percpu refcounts is shutdown. We can't detect
 * the ref hitting 0 on every put - this would require global synchronization
 * and defeat the whole purpose of using percpu refs.
 *
 * What we do is require the user to keep track of the initial refcount; we know
 * the ref can't hit 0 before the user drops the initial ref, so as long as we
 * convert to non percpu mode before the initial ref is dropped everything
 * works.
 *
 * Converting to non percpu mode is done with some RCUish stuff in
 * percpu_ref_kill. Additionally, we need a bias value so that the
 * atomic_long_t can't hit 0 before we've added up all the percpu refs.
