  [ Martin Pitt ]

ureadahead (0.100.0-8) maverick; urgency=low

  * Decrease the buffer size to just 8MB, after much testing we don't
    need much more than this since it will be limited by the size of the
    page cache anyway.

    This is in lieu of a new version of ureadahead for Maverick, which
    while work is ongoing, isn't ready for shipping at this time.
    LP: #600359.

ureadahead (0.100.0-7) maverick; urgency=low

  * Count the number of CPUs and divide buffer_size_kb by the number of CPUs.
    Users should watch for instances of "mmiotrace has lost events" in dmesg to make
    sure the trace buffers are not too small. The original value for
    buffer_size_kb was chosen somewhat arbitrarily. Empirical testing
    has shown that its large enough, so we don't actually know where the lower
    boundary lies.

ureadahead (0.100.0-6) maverick; urgency=low

  * Restore buffer_size_kb upon exit, but do it _after_
    the trace buffer has been read. This frees the memory
    consumed by the trace operation (which can be a lot).

    contains all the clean-up stuff so we want to keep it for the

ureadahead (0.90.3-2) karmic-proposed; urgency=low

  * Ã¼ber-readahead is a replacement for sreadahead that should
    significantly improve boot performance on rotational hard drives,
    especially those that had regressed in performance from jaunty to
    karmic.

    It does this by pre-loading such things as ext2/3/4 inodes and opening
    files in as logical order as possible before loading all blocks in one
    pass across the disk.

    On SSD, this behaves much as sreadahead used to, replacing that package
    with slightly improved tracing code.

    This requires the kernel package also found in karmic-proposed.

    LP: #432089.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 09 Nov 2009 18:38:51 +0000

ureadahead (0.90.3-1) karmic; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Move ext2fs inode group lookup into the tracing stage, storing the
      groups to preload in the pack, rather than spending time on normal
      boots working it out.
    - Open files in order of inode group (or inode number on non-ext2fs),
      which seems to give a benefit in load time and certainly produces
      better blktrace output.
    - Increase the "too old" check from a month to a year.
    - Fix dump of zero-byte files to not claim a single page.
    - Fix unhandled error output when given an unknown pack file.
    - Don't call ureadhead for the root filesystem twice on boot (the second
      time should only take a few ms, but that's still time)
    - Consider exit status 4 (no pack file for given mount point) normal.
    - Make uselib tracing optional.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 05 Nov 2009 15:10:06 +0000

ureadahead (0.90.2-1) karmic; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - improved SSD mode
    - inode group preload threshold configurable by environment variable
    - default inode group preload threshold changed to 16, because random
      stabbing in the dark suggested it was a good number
    - add a job that profiles extra mountpoints

  * Remove /etc/cron.monthly/sreadahead too.
  * Add an apport hook to attach a dump of the packs.
